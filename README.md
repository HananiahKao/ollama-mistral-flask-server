# Ollama Mistral Flask Server

This project is a Flask server that uses Ollama's Mistral model to generate HTML content based on a requested URL and its context.

## Features
- Accepts a URL as input.
- Fetches the first three lines of visible text from the URL.
- Sends the URL and context to Ollama's Mistral model.
- Returns generated HTML content.

## Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Ensure Ollama is running locally and the Mistral model is available:**
   ```bash
   ollama run mistral
   ```
4. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

Send a GET request to:
```
http://localhost:5000/generate?url=https://example.com
```

The server will fetch the URL, extract context, and return HTML generated by the Mistral model.
